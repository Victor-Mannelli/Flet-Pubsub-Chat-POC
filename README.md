# Live Chat Project

This project, developed as part of the Python Dev course, aims to create a live chat application called HashZap, similar to WhatsApp. It serves as a proof of concept (POC) for chats in real-time.

## Overview

HashZap provides a live chat experience where users can engage in conversations as if it were a normal chat. However, there is no chat history visible to users; messages are only visible to those present in the chat at the time. If a user leaves and rejoins the chat, they will only see messages sent after they rejoin.

The chat is implemented within a website; Instructions on installing and configuring these libraries are provided to ensure the project functions correctly.

## Key Features

- Live chat functionality
- Real-time messaging

## Usage

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
